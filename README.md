# Suicide_Rates_Project

The new data set that I have chosen is in the domain of suicides. This data set takes data from many different countries, age groups, and both sexes. One of the first things that I had to consider doing was if I should create a subset of the data set that I was analyzing. The thought that was behind this decision was because there was so much data about so many different countries so I felt that focusing the data more on the United States would help me hone into some better and more accurate analysis. During this project I performed Linear Regression, Correlation Matrix, and K Means Clustering. I built some user input methods so that a user can input the required data in and get the predicted suicide rate based on the linear regression model that I built.
